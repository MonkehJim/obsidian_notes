### Using range() to make lists of numbers 
A function called `list()` can make the output of a function as a list. Taking the `range()` function and placing it inside the `list()` will generate a list of numbers, based on the range's specified values.
```Python
numbers = list(range(1,6))
print(numbers)

[1,2,3,4,5]
```
